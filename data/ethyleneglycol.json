Acute (short-term) exposure of humans to ethylene glycol by ingesting large quantities causes three stages of health effects: central nervous system (CNS) depression, followed by cardiopulmonary effects, and later renal damage. The only effects noted in one study of individuals exposed to low levels of ethylene glycol by inhalation for about a month were throat and upper respiratory tract irritation. Rats and mice chronically (long-term) exposed to ethylene glycol in their diet exhibited signs of kidney toxicity and liver effects. Several studies of rodents exposed orally or by inhalation showed ethylene glycol to be fetotoxic. An epidemiologic study on renal cancer mortality did not find an increased risk for workers exposed to ethylene glycol. EPA has not classified ethylene glycol for carcinogenicity.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Glyoxylic acid is then metabolized into a number of chemicals that have been identified in expired air, urine, or blood. ...The metabolism of ethylene glycol to glycoaldehyde is mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase. Glycoaldehyde is metabolized to glycolic acid by aldehyde oxidase or to a lesser extent to glyoxal. Glyoxal is changed both to glycolic acid in the presence of lactic dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, or possibly both enzymes, and to glyoxylic acid via some oxidative mechanism. The main path of the degradation of glycolic acid is to glyoxylic acid. This reaction is mediated by lactic dehydrogenase or glycolic acid oxidase. Once glyoxylic acid is formed, it is apparently degraded very rapidly to a variety of products, a few of which have been observed. Its breakdown to 2-hydroxy-3-oxoadipate it is thought, is mediated by thiamine pyrophosphate in the presence of magnesium ions. The formation of glycine involves pyridoxal phosphate and glyoxylate transaminase, whereas the formation of carbon dioxide and water via formic acid apparently involves coenzyme A (CoA) and flavin mononucleotides. Oxalic acid formation from glyoxylic acid, has been considered to be the results from the action of lactic dehydrogenase or glycolic acid oxidase.",

The metabolism of glyoxylate follows several pathways that depend on the cofactors thiamine and pyridoxine. The oxidation of ethylene glycol to glyoxylate and subsequently to oxalate requires the conversion of NAD to NADH. The altered NAD/NADH ratio shifts pyruvate to lactate and thereby helps produce lactic acidosis. The acidic metabolites are more toxic than the parent compound. The order of toxicity appears to be glyoxylate > glycolaldehyde > ethylene glycol.",

The oxidation of ethylene-glycol to produce formaldehyde was NADPH dependent and carbon-monoxide sensitive. Aniline, p-nitrophenol, pyrazole, 4-methylpyrazole, tryptamine, cimetidine, and micronazole inhibited the production of formaldehyde. Ethylene-glycol was oxidized at rates which were about twice those found with control microsomes in microsomes isolated from rats treated with pyrazole or 4-methylpyrazole to induce cytochrome p450IIEl. Formaldehyde production was inhibited by antibody raised against the pyrazole induced p450IIEl in microsomes from pyrazole treated rats. Hydrogen-peroxide itself did not oxidize ethylene-glycol to formaldehyde. However, stimulation of catalase or glutathione plus glutathione-peroxidase through added hydrogen-peroxide inhibited the microsomal reaction in the presence of NADPH. Formaldehyde production was also inhibited by desferrioxamine, EDTA and DTPA. Findings suggested that the oxidant derived from hydrogen-peroxide and iron and responsible for the production of formaldehyde from ethylene-glycol was not superoxide, hydroxyl radical, or lipid hydroperoxide. The authors suggest that ethylene-glycol is oxidized to formaldehyde by an oxidant derived from hydrogen-peroxide and nonheme iron, and that cytochrome p450 may function to generate the hydrogen-peroxide and to catalyze reduction of the nonheme iron.",

Urinary oxalic acid and alkoxyacetic acid excretion together was found to relate to the decrease of the succinate dehydrogenase activity as an indicator of renal mitochondrial effects. The excretion of ammonia by exposed workers was doubled as compared to controls. The excretion of chloride was found to be smaller in the exposed than in controls.

The only effects noted in one study of individuals exposed to low levels of ethylene glycol by inhalation for about a month were throat and upper respiratory tract irritation. Rats and mice chronically (long-term) exposed to ethylene glycol in their diet exhibited signs of kidney toxicity and liver effects. Several studies of rodents exposed orally or by inhalation showed ethylene glycol to be fetotoxic. An epidemiologic study on renal cancer mortality did not find an increased risk for workers exposed to ethylene glycol. EPA has not classified ethylene glycol for carcinogenicity.",

If symptoms such as redness or irritation develop, IMMEDIATELY call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital for treatment.  INHALATION: IMMEDIATELY leave the contaminated area; take deep breaths of fresh air. If symptoms (such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or burning in the mouth, throat, or chest) develop, call a physician and be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital. Provide proper respiratory protection to rescuers entering an unknown atmosphere. Whenever possible, Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used; if not available, use a level of protection greater than or equal to that advised under Protective Clothing.  INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. Be prepared to transport the victim to a hospital if advised by a physician. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body.

Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Ethylene glycol is found on List D. Case No: 4033; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): Ethylene glycol; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

We have examined the effect of 1-alpha-vitamin D(3) on urinary oxalate and glycolate excretion. Our results indicate that 1-alpha-D(3), together with ethylene glycol, caused a significant increase in urinary glycolate, without a parallel rise in urinary oxalate excretion, in ethylene glycol-fed rats. This increase in urinary glycolate was due to the synergistic effect of both drugs.",

This chemical has numerous uses, in manufacturing of polyethylene terephthalate, in natural gas processing, and as an antifreeze agent. HUMAN EXPOSURE: In humans ethylene glycol has induced only minimal dermal irritation, Nasal and or throat irritation were reported in a small number of subjects inhaling ethylene glycol, while higher concentrations caused eye irritation. Available data from acute poisoning cases indicate that the kidney is the critical organ for the toxicity of ethylene glycol. Available data are inadequate to assess the potential adverse neurological or immunological effects associated with long term exposure to ethylene glycol, although neurobehavioral and neurological disorders have been reported in cases of acute ethylene glycol poisonings in humans. In the limited number of investigations examined, neurological effects have not been observed at doses below those that have induced renal toxicity. ANIMAL STUDIES: Ethylene glycol has low acute toxicity in experimental animals following oral, inhalation and dermal exposure. Ethylene glycol exhibited no evidence of carcinogenicity based on a two year bioassay with rats and mice. Ethylene glycol induces developmental effects in rats and mice by all routes of exposure, although at doses greater than those associated with renal effects in male rats. Ethylene glycol is teratogenic, inducing primarily skeletal and external malformations, sometimes at doses less than those that are maternally toxic, with mice being more sensitive than rats. Reproductive studies with ethylene glycol show that in repeated dose toxicity studies, no evidence of an adverse impact on reproductive organs was observed. In special studies, including a three generation study in rats and continuous breeding protocols in mice, evidence of reproductive effects have been restricted to mice (but not rabbits or rats) exposed to doses considerably higher than those associated with developmental effects in this species or renal effects in rats. Consistent treatment related effects on  the immune system related parameters have not be observed in repeated dose toxicity studies, in which several species have been exposed to ethylene glycol either orally or by inhalation.",

The minimum serum concentration of ethylene glycol associated with serious toxicity is not known. In addition, ethylene glycol levels are reported to rebound after dialysis ceases. Therefore, treatment with fomepizole and ethanol should be continued until the osmolar and anion gaps are normalized or (if available) serum ethylene glycol and glycolic acid levels are no longer detectable.",

As the patient was seen soon after poisoning, before the development of metabolic acidosis, therapy with 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) was proposed as an antidote. 4-MP was administered via the intravenous route... . 4-MP alone was effective in preventing EG biotransformation to toxic metabolites (absence of metabolic acidosis and renal injury). Ethanol therapy, hemodialysis, and sodium bicarbonate administration were not required. The half-life of EG during 4-MP therapy was 11 hr, with a mean EG renal clearance of 26.9 mL/min, and a total of 65.3 g EG was eliminated unchanged in the urine. 4-MP therapy was also well tolerated.",

A case of massive ethylene glycol ingestion resulting in the highest serum ethylene glycol concentration in a patient without ethanol co-ingestion who was treated with fomepizole and was not hemodialyzed /is reported/. A 48-year-old male presented to the emergency department after reportedly ingesting >1 liter of antifreeze in an attempt at self-harm. He denied concomitant ethanol consumption. His initial presenting serum ethylene glycol level was 700 mg/dL, with normal renal function, and a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap. One hour after presentation, he was started on intravenous fomepizole. Treatment with fomepizole continued until the patient's plasma ethylene glycol concentration was 16 mg/dL. His metabolic acidosis quickly resolved, he had no adverse reactions to the treatment, and his renal function remained normal. Ultimately, he was discharged to a psychiatric unit without sequelae. Published literature and practice guidelines suggests considering hemodialysis initiation in patients with an ethylene glycol level > 50 mg/dL. This recommendation is anecdotally, rather than evidence, based. With the potential risks inherent in hemodialysis, our case provides evidence that treatment with fomepizole without hemodialysis appears to be a viable alternative option in patients with even extremely high plasma ethylene glycol concentrations as long as their renal function is intact.",

In patient 2, Cmax of ethylene glycol during the 2 admissions were 18 mmol/L and 45 mmol/L. In patient 1, a blood ethyl alcohol level of 130-140 mg/dL was reached in 3 hr and was maintained for 22 hr. During this period, ethylene glycol metabolism was effectively inhibited and 88% of eliminated ethylene glycol was accounted for in urine. During the admissions of patient 2, ethyl alcohol was presumed to effectively inhibit ethylene glycol metabolism.

It was part of a large structure-activity series of glycol ethers & congeners evaluated using this design, generating data on compounds for which there were few or no reproductive data in the open literature. Food & water consumption, body weight & clinical sign data from Task 1 were used to set levels for the Task 2 at 0.0, 0.25%, 0.50%, & 1.0% EG in drinking water. Based on water consumption data collected during Task 2, these concns produced calculated EG consumptions of approx 400, 850, & 1700 mg/kg/day. There was no EG-related depression of body weight during the cohabitation phase of the study. For the cohabitation phase, the total number of litters/pair was reduced by 9% at the high dose, & the mean number of pups/litter was reduced by nearly equal to 5%. Pup weight (both absolute & adjusted for litter size) was also reduced at the middle & top doses by 3% & 7%, respectively. The relatively small degree of change in pup number contributed to the decision not to conduct a Task 3 crossover mating to determine the affected sex. Thus, the F0 mice were killed at the end of the cohabitation phase (Task 2), & discarded without necropsy. It was noted during the nursing period that selected high-dose F1's had abnormal facial development. Selected affected animals were necropsied at weaning, & their skeletons stained with Alizarin Red S. Rib/vertebral & facial bone abnormalities were noted in the treated skeletons, & were absent from the controls. The remaining mice from the control & high dose groups were evaluated by an F1 mating trial at 74 +/- 10 days of age. There were no significant effects of EG consumption on the number or viability of F2 pups. Pup weight adjusted for litter size was reduced by 5%, a change of borderline significance (p=0.064). After the F2 litters were born, the F1 adults were killed & necropsied. Terminal body weight was not changed, but there was a nearly equal to 8.5% reduction in brain weight in both sexes, & a 9% reduction in relative liver weight for females. These data show that EG, at sufficient doses, can reduce litter size & pup weight without affecting F0 body weight. Of potentially more interest, however, were the skeletal terata induced by 1% EG consumption.",

This study used a higher top dose, & incorporated a crossover mating, & an evaluation of all dose levels in F1's. Based on the data from the previous study, doses for this study were set at 0.0, 0.5%, 1.0%, & 1.5% EG in drinking water for approx 21 wks. Based on water consumption data collected during this study, these concns produced calculated EG consumptions of nearly equal to 850, 1800, & 2800 mg/kg/day. Body weight was not affected during the Task 2 cohabitation phase. While the number of litters/pair was unchanged, the number of pups/litter was reduced by nearly equal to 15% at the top dose, & the pup weight adjusted for litter size was reduced by 3%, 7%, & 10% (low to high doses, respectively). After the last litter was delivered & reared to weaning, the control & 1.5% EG F0 mice were cross-mated in Task 3 to determine the affected sex. While the number of pups/litter was the same as controls, the adjusted pup weight was 9% lower than controls in the control male x 1.5% EG female group. After the last Task 3 litter was delivered, the females were subject to vaginal lavage for 7 days, & then all control & 1.5% EG mice were necropsied. While female body weight was unchanged by 1.5% EG consumption, male body weight was reduced by 9%; organ weights were unaffected. Sperm motility at 1.5%EG was reduced by 15%, & the frequency of abnormal sperm rose from 5% (controls) to 8% (1.5%EG). Estrous cycle length was unaffected by EG exposure. No treatment-related microscopic lesions were seen in tissues of the 1.5% EG females. Renal tubule lesions were noted in 60% of male mice, concomitant with the presence of crystals presumed to be oxalate. Serum total calcium levels were the same across all dose groups. All offspring from the last litter of F1's were reared & dosed until mating at /postnatal day/ 74+/-10. Dosing continued through the wk of mating, & until sacrifice. There were no effects on the indices of mating & fertility, & the number of pups/litter was unchanged, but pup weight adjusted for litter size was reduced by 5, 5, & 6% in the low, middle, & high doses, respectively. All dose groups of F1 mice were killed & necropsied after vaginal lavage. Female body weight & weights of liver & kidney were not affected at any dose level, & male body weights were not different across dose groups. Absolute testis weight was reduced by 12%, 15%, & 15% as dose increased, & adjusted right epididymis weight was reduced by 9 & 11% in the middle & top dose groups, respectively. Sperm count was reduced by 23%, 18%, & 17% as dose increased; only the first two were significant. The % motile sperm was reduced by 3 & 12% in the middle & top dose groups, respectively. Estrous cycle length & characteristics were unchanged. Total serum calcium was measured in all dose groups, & was not changed by EG exposure. Microscopically, there was a greater incidence & severity of testicular damage in the 1.5%EG males, but neither sex showed signs of renal damage or regeneration. This study repeated the findings of facial structural abnormalities (cleft palate & ablepheron). These were seen in the middle & top dose groups, & were also seen in Task 3 only in pups born to EG-exposed dams. This repeat ethylene glycol study used a higher top dose to confirm the reproductive & developmental toxicities caused by EG in Swiss mice. These were seen in the presence of a 9% change in body weight only in F0 males.",

Ethylene glycol (EG) (O, 750, 1500, and 3000 mg/kg/day, po) in distilled water was administered in a volume of 10 ml per kilogram of body weight on gestational days (gd) 6 through 15. Females were weighed and observed during daily treatment for clinical signs of toxicity. At sacrifice on gestational days 17, a total of 23-25 dams (i.e., confirmed-pregnant females) per treatment group were evaluated. The gravid uterus of each dam was weighed, and the status of uterine implantation sites were recorded (i.e., number of resorptions, dead fetuses, and live fetuses). All live fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. No unscheduled maternal deaths occurred during this investigation, nor were any distinctive clinical signs associated with ethylene glycol treatment other than piloerection and maternal body weight loss. Maternal body weight on gestational days O and 6 (i.e., prior to the initiation of treatment) did not differ significantly among treatment groups. On gestational days 11, 15, and 17, maternal body weight was decreased across treatment groups in a dose-related manner, and both the mid-and high-dose groups were significantly below vehicle controls. Maternal weight gain during the treatment period, as well as maternal weight gain for the entire gestational period, was negatively associated with dose (i.e., weight gain decreased with increasing dose) and was significantly below vehicle controls for both the mid-and high-dose ethylene glycol groups. When gravid uterine weight was subtracted from total gestational weight gain, none of the ethylene glycol-treated groups were significantly different from vehicle controls with regard to absolute maternal weight gain, but a dose-related downward trend in absolute weight gain was observed as dosage increased. A significant dose-related reduction in gravid uterine weight was observed, which was significantly below vehicle controls for both the mid-and high-dose groups, and appeared to account for the corresponding reductions in maternal body weight on gd 17. Maternal liver weight (g) displayed a statistically significant dose-related decrease, and both the mid- and high-dose groups were significantly below vehicle controls by pairwise comparison. No significant differences among dose groups were observed for relative maternal liver weight (% body weight). Indices of reproductive competence prior to the initiation of treatment on gd 6 revealed a preexisting difference among dose groups; i.e., statistically significant differences were observed for the number of corpora lutea per dam and number of implantation sites per dam, but not for percent preimplantation loss. Specifically, dams in the mid-dose group (1500 mg/kg/day ethylene glycol) had a lower average number of corpora lutea and a corresponding decrease in the number of implantation sites per litter as compared to vehicle control dams. Viability of implanted embryos was significantly affected in the high-dose group (19.86% resorptions per litter) when compared to vehicle controls (8.74% resorptions per litter). A significant dose-related trend toward an increased proportion of litters with one or more resorptions per litter was also observed. The incidence of \"dead\" fetuses (i.e., fetuses weighing greater than 0.3 g, having discernible digits and exhibiting no vital signs at uterine dissection on gestational days 17) was decreased in dose-related manner and the mid- and high-dose ethylene glycol groups were significantly below vehicle controls on this measure. The proportion of litters with one or more dead fetuses was significantly below vehicle controls for the mid-dose group. In summarizing post-implantation mortality (i.e., resorptions plus dead fetuses), the percent nonlive implants per litter exhibited a dose-related increase as dosage increased, but none of the individual treatment groups were significantly different from vehicle control by pairwise comparison. Similarly, the proportion of litters with one or more nonlive implants exhibited a dose-related upward trend as dosage increased, but no significant differences were observed between individual treatment groups and vehicle control. When the outcome of pregnancy was considered as a whole (i.e., accounting for all resorp-tions, dead fetuses and malformed live fetuses from all confirmed-pregnant dams), there was a significant increase in the percent of conceptuses per litter which were adversely affected during the post-implantation phase of gestation; this increase reached statistical significance for both the mid- and high-dose groups. The percent of adversely affected implants per litter exhibited a significant dose-related trend and occurred with the following incidence for the vehicle control through high-dose groups, respectively: 11.17%, 19.65%, 50.67%, and 64.41%. The percent of litters containing one or more affected implants also increased with dose, i.e., 72.0%, 83.3%, 95.7%, and 100.0%, respectively; the increases for this parameter were statistically higher than vehicle controls for both the mid-and the high-dose groups. Statistical evaluation of litters containing at least one live fetus (herein referred to as \"live litters\"), revealed a significant dose-relate reduction in the number of live fetuses per live litter which was significantly below vehicle controls at the highest dose of ethylene glycol (3000 mg/kg/day). No treatment-relate effect was observed on the percentage of live male fetuses per litter. Average live fetal body weight per live litter was negatively associated with dose and was statistically below vehicle controls for all doses tested, with males and females being equally affected on this measure. The percentage of malformed live fetuses per live litter was positively associated with dose and displayed the following incidence for the vehicle control through high-dose groups, respectively: 0.25%, 10.00%, 37.77%, and 56.54%. The percentage of malformed live fetuses per live litter was statistically higher than vehicle controls for all ethylene glycol-treated groups. When incidence of malformations was analyzed by fetal sex, male fetuses exhibited an increased incidence of malformations at all ethylene glycol doses, but female fetuses exhibited an increase only in the mid-and high-dose groups. However, the absence of a significant dose x sex interaction in a dose (4) x replicate (2) x sex (2) ANOVA design with sex as a repeated measure, indicated that no robust sex-selective effect was observed with regard to the incidence of malformed live fetuses. The proportion of live litters containing at least one malformed live fetus also increased with dose and displayed an incidence of 4.00%, 66.67%, 81. 82%, and 95.65% in the vehicle control through high-dose respectively. The proportion of live litters with malformed live fetuses was significantly elevated in all ethylene glycol-treated groups relative to the vehicle control group. A diversity of gross, visceral, and skeletal malformations were observed with the most characteristic malformations involving craniofacial and skeletal dysmorphogenesis. Report Date: July 23, 1984",

                        "String": "Ethylene glycol (EG) ... was administered by gavage to pregnant CD rats (F0 generation) on gestational days (gd) 6 through 20 at doses of 0, 250, 1250 or 2250 mg/kg/day (i.e., 0, 4. 20 or 36 mmol/kg/day, respectively). The offspring (F1 generation) were fostered to untreated mothers on postnatal day (gd) 1 and evaluated for postnatal growth and viability, developmental landmarks, sexual maturation, locomotor activity and performance of a complex learning task. Maternal body weight (gd 20) and weight gain during treatment and gestation were negatively influenced by 2250 mg ethylene glycol/kg/day, but similar effects were not found at lower doses. The gestational period was significantly longer in dams exposed to 1250 or 2250 mg/kg/day ethylene glycol. On pnd 1, absolute and relative maternal kidney weights and postpartum uterine weight were decreased in the high- dose group. No differences among groups were noted on pnd 1 for maternal body weight, maternal liver weight, or number of implantation sites per dam. Evidence of treatment-related renal pathology was noted in 27% (4/15) of females examined in the mid- dose group and in 33% (5/15) of females examined in the high-dose group, as compared to a 0% (0/18) incidence of similar lesions in the control group. Per the study protocol, no other maternal organs were examined microscopically. Live litter size and neonatal pup body weight were decreased, and cumulative mortality of offspring through pnd 4 (expressed as a percent of implantation sites) was increased in the high-dose group. There was no effect of treatment on the age of incisor eruption or development of external genitalia (i.e., vaginal opening or testes descent). While there was an initial difference between groups in the percentage of pups per litter with wire grasping skills on pnd 9 (9%, 18%, 40% and 37% for control through high-dose groups, respectively), by pnd 10, the control group contained 70% pups per litter with wire grasping skills, and no differences among groups were noted on pnd 10-15. Thus, no adverse effects of prenatal ethylene glycol upon postnatal acquisition of wire grasping skills were observed. There were no statistically significant effects of treatment on exploratory behavior (preweaning) or performance on a visual discrimination task (~12-24 weeks of age). A significant increase in skeletal malformations was observed on pnd 22 for pups in the 2250 mg EG/kg/day group. Hydrocephalus was observed in the 250 and 2250 mg/kg/day groups, but not at 1250 mg/kg/day, suggesting that the incidence was related to treatment only at the high dose. Relative kidney weights tended to be lower than controls on pnd 63 at the mid- and high-dose levels. However, no treatment-related pathology was noted upon microscopic examination of the liver or kidneys collected from F1 pups at scheduled sacrifices on pnd 4, 22 or 63. In summary, administration of ethylene glycol (EG) to timed-mated CD rats on gd 6 through 20 resulted in no observed toxicity at 250 mg/kg/day. At 1250 mg/kg/day, the gestational period was lengthened, and maternal renal pathology was noted, but no adverse developmental effects were observed. At 2250 mg/kg/day, reduction of maternal body weight, weight gain, kidney weight and postpartum uterine weight were observed. In addition, gestation was lengthened and maternal renal pathology was present. Developmental toxicity at 2250 mg/kg/day included reduced pup body weight, reduced viability and increased malformation incidence (primarily hydrocephaly and abnormalities of the axial skeleton), but adverse effects upon other indices of postnatal development were not observed.",

Clinical signs were recorded daily during treatment and on gestational days 25 and 30 (animals were observed at least once daily throughout the study); maternal body weights were recorded on gestational days 0, 6-19, 25 and 30 and maternal water consumption was measured daily. At necropsy (gestational days 30), maternal body weight, liver weight, kidney weight and gravid uterine weight were recorded. ... Ethylene glycol administered by gavage to pregnant New Zealand White rabbits during major organogenesis resulted in profound maternal toxicity (42% mortality; three early deliveries and one spontaneous abortion) at 2000 mg/kg/day associated with renal pathology and unaccompanied by any other indicators of maternal toxicity such as effects on periodic maternal body weights or weight change or on water consumption. At necropsy, there were no significant effects on gravid uterine weight, liver or kidney weights. The kidney lesion at 2000 mg/kg/day was limited to the cortical renal tubules and included intraluminal oxalate crystals, epithelial necrosis and tubular dilatation and renal tubular degeneration. There was no dose-related maternal toxicity at 100-1000 mg/kg/day . There was no indication of developmental toxicity including no effects on pre- or post implantation loss, the number of fetuses per litter, fetal body weight per litter or sex ratio (% male fetuses per litter), and no evidence of teratogenicity based on evaluation of external, visceral including craniofacial, skeletal or total malformations or variations at any dose tested. These dose levels include a dose which resulted in severe maternal toxicity (2000 mg/kg/day ) and doses which produced no observable maternal toxicity (100-1000 mg/kg/day ). The No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for maternal toxicity was therefore 1000 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL for developmental toxicity was at least 2000 mg/kg/day under the conditions of this study. The sensitivity of New Zealand White rabbits relative to CDÂ® rats and CDÂ®-I mice previously evaluated for maternal and developmental toxicity from gavage administration of ethylene glycol during organogenesis can be determined for maternal toxicity: rabbits more sensitive than mice, mice more sensitive than rats, and for developmental toxicity: mice more sensitive than rats, and rats more sensitive than rabbits.",

Subsequently, two groups of dams were killed on gd 18 or 20, and fetal skeletons were double-stained and examined for degree of ossification in selected regions as well as for skeletal malformations. Other groups of dams were allowed to deliver their litters which were fostered to untreated dams on postnatal day (pnd) 1. Pups were sacrificed by litter on postnatal day 1, 4, 14, 21 or 63. Pup skeletons were double-stained and examined for degree of ossification and skeletal malformations. Maternal body weight after initiation of dosing and weight gain during gestation were significantly below controls in the gd 18 and postnatal day 1 ethylene glycol groups. Corrected maternal weight gain was reduced in the gd 18 ethylene glycol group only. Gd 20 and postnatal day 63 ethylene glycol groups had significantly decreased weight gain during treatment. ... Fetal weights per litter were significantly decreased with ethylene glycol treatment in the gd 18 and 20 groups. There was no increase in % resorptions per litter in ethylene glycol treated dams sacrificed on gd 18 or 20. No significant effects of treatment were seen for pup body weight in any of the individual or combined postnatal groups except that body weight on postnatal day 1 for all postnatal ethylene glycol groups combined was significantly below controls. Number of live pups per litter were significantly lower on postnatal day 1 in the postnatal day 1 ethylene glycol group only. Percent fetuses/pups with skeletal malformations per litter were significantly increased in all ethylene glycol groups except for the postnatal day 63 group, with a predominance of axial skeletal defects. Percent total ossification, percent sternebrae ossified and percent vertebral central ossified were significantly reduced in the ethylene glycol groups but were not significantly different when co-varied by body weight on gd 18, 20 or postnatal day 63. All were significantly lower than controls in the postnatal day 1 through postnatal day 21 groups. There was no effect of dose or body weight on ossification of fore or hind limb digits. In conclusion, ethylene glycol treatment caused developmental delays and apparent malformations in the perinatal rat skeleton which were resolved by postnatal day 63.",

Signs of maternal toxicity included: labored respiration (500 mg/kg); hypoactivity, red urogenital discharge, and a hunched posture (50, 500 and 1500 mg/kg); ataxia (50 and 1500 mg/kg); and ocular discharge and slight reductions in body weights (1500 mg/kg). Examination of the uteri revealed slight increases in early resorptions and non-viable implants/litter at 1500 mg/kg. Significantly reduced fetal body weights and increased fetal skeletal malformations were observed at 1500 mg/kg.

Fetuses were counted, weighed, sexed and examined for external, visceral and skeletal abnormalities and some were sectioned for examination of craniofacial abnormalities. A water (vehicle) control group was similarly treated. At the highest dose level there were maternal toxicity effects including reduced gestational and terminal body weight and weight changes, increased water consumption and increased relative kidney weight. Increased relative liver weights were also observed in all levels except the 500 mg/kg, so the authors conclude that this was not an effect of chemical treatment. Fetotoxic effects included skeletal malformations at the two highest dose levels and gastroschisis at the highest level. A variety of statistical tests were used to analyze the results.

Body weights and weight gains were comparable in all groups, except high dose and positive control dams had gestational weight minus gravid uterine weight increased relative to controls. Water consumption increased in positive controls during treatment. Gross necropsies were unremarkable, but kidney damage observed on microscopic examination in positive control dams affected 3 high dose dams. There were no treatment-related differences among groups in number of corpora lutea/dam, total, nonviable or viable implantations/litter, or fetal sex ratio. Incidence of late resorptions and dead fetuses was reduced in the low dose group. Fetal body weights were reduced only in positive controls. Many fetal malformations and variations were found in positive controls, not in dermally treated dams.

Animals were sacrificed on day 18 of gestation. Maternal animals at 100 and 2500 mg/cu m showed reduced body weight and body weight gain and reduced gravid uterine weight. A reduced number of viable implantations per litter and increased non-viable implantations were seen at 1000 and 2500 mg/cu m. Fetal body weights were also reduced at 100 and 2500 mg/cu m. There was an increased incidence of total external, visceral, and skeletal malformations at 1000 and 2500 mg/cu m. These malformations included exencephaly, cleft palate, foreshortened and abnormal face, abnormal facial bones, vertebral fusions, and fused, forked and missing ribs.

Ethylene glycol's use as a component of deicing fluid for airport runways and drilling fluids will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0878 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates ethylene glycol will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethylene glycol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Ethylene glycol is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight since it does not contain functional groups that are expected to absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm. If released to soil, ethylene glycol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 0.2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.00X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Ethylene glycol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Ethylene glycol is biodegraded in soil 97-100% in 2-12 days. If released into water, ethylene glycol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. In a river die-away test, degradation was complete within 3 days at 20 Â°C and 5-14 days at 8 Â°C. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. A BCF of 10, reported for ethylene glycol in fish, Golden ide (Leuciscus idus melanotus), after 3 days of exposure suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to ethylene glycol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethylene glycol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethylene glycol via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with consumer products containing ethylene glycol. The primary exposure to ethylene glycol for the general population is probably from contact with antifreeze, coolants, and latex paints containing ethylene glycol. (SRC)",

Ethylene glycol at 100 ppm and 1000 ppm required 6 and 8 days, respectively, for complete biodegradation using a Mississippi soil inoculum(5). Biodegradation of aircraft deicing fluid components, containing ethylene glycol, was studied at 8 Â°C using a sandy loam soil collected from the side of an airport runway; corrected biodegradation rates of ethylene glycol ranged from 18.9-20.3 mg/kg of soil per day(6). Complete disappearance was reported in 29 days; 63% of the theoretical carbon dioxide was recovered after 34 days indicating that substantial mineralization was taking place(6).",

Ethylene glycol was shown to migrate into food simulants from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used in the packaging of carbonated beverages. The compound was detected at a concentration of about 100 ppb (94 ug/bottle) in a 3% acetic acid solution used as a food simulant after 6 months of storage at 32 Â°C with unreacted ethylene glycol in the polyethylene terephthalate polymer being the likely source(2).",

Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethylene glycol via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with consumer products containing ethylene glycol. The primary exposure to ethylene glycol for the general population is from contact with antifreeze, coolants, and latex paints containing ethylene glycol(SRC). Fifteen minute air samples were taken from the inside of trucks being used to spray ethylene glycol on bridge surfaces; concentrations of ethylene glycol aerosol ranged from <0.05 to 2.33 mg/cu m; concentrations of ethylene glycol vapor ranged from <0.05 to 3.36 mg/cu m(2).",

In another study of 10 car mechanics urinary concentrations of ethylene glycol were 7.3-47 mmol/mol creatinine verses non-mechanics (office workers) that had levels of 1.7-36 mmol/mol creatinine.  A German study reported that workers that had no occupational exposure to ethylene glycol had mean and median urine concentrations of 0.31 and 0.23 mg/L respectively(3).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",
