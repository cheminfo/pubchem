For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

TEA was efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, rapidly distributed, and in part metabolized into TEAO. There was no significant first pass metabolism. TEAO was also well absorbed from the GI tract. Within the GI tract, TEAO was reduced into TEA (19%) and dealkylated into diethylamine (DEA; 10%). The apparent volumes of distribution during the elimination phase were 192 liters for TEA and 103 liters for TEAO. Gastric intubation showed that there was a close association between levels of TEA in plasma and gastric juice, the latter levels being 30 times higher. The TEA and TEAO in plasma had half-lives of about 3 and 4 hr, respectively. Exhalation of TEA was minimal. More than 90% of the dose was recovered in the urine as TEA and TEAO. The urinary clearances of TEA and TEAO indicated that in addition to glomerular filtration, tubular secretion takes place. For TEAO at high levels, the secretion appears to be saturable. The present data, in combination with those of earlier studies, indicate that the sum of TEA and TEAO in urine may be used for biological monitoring of exposure to TEA.",

Air samples were collected by pumping of air through activated-charcoal-filled glass tubes, and pre- and postshift urine samples were collected. The TEA concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. TEA was measured in air and urine samples from the same shift. Breathing-zone measurements of 19 workers in 3 foundries were included in the study, and stationary and continuous air measurements were also made in the same foundries. Pre- and postshift urine samples were analyzed for their TEA and triethylamine-N-oxide (TEAO) concentrations. The TEA concentration range was 0.3-23 mg/cu m in the breathing zone of the core makers. The mean 8-hr time-weighted average exposure levels were 1.3, 4.0, and 13 mg/cu m for the three foundries. Most of the preshift urinary TEA concentrations were under the detection limit, whereas the postshift urinary TEA concentrations ranged between 5.6 and 171 mmol/mol creatinine. The TEAO concentrations were 4-34% (mean 19%) of the summed TEA + TEAO concentrations. The correlation between air and urine measurements was high (r=0.96, p<0.001). A TEA air concentration of 4.1 mg/cu m (the current ACGIH 8-hr time-weighted average threshold limit value) corresponded to a urinary concentration of 36 mmol/mol creatinine.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)Â® while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as catalytic solvent in chemical synthesis; accelerator activators for rubber; wetting, penetrating, and waterproofing agents of quaternary ammonium types; curing and hardening of polymers; corrosion inhibitor; propellant. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Aside from irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract, triethylamine also stimulates the central nervous system, because it inhibits monamine oxidase. Experimental studies were conducted in four healthy men on the metabolism of inhaled TEA (20 mg/cu m) with and without ethanol ingestion. Three subjects displayed visual disturbances in the experiments without ethanol. These same subjects did not experience any visual disturbances in those experiments containing ethanol. In another study, four hour exposure to a TEA concentration of 3.0 mg/cu m seemed to cause no effects, whereas exposure to 6.5 mg/cu m for the same period caused blurred vision and a decrease in contrast sensitivity. Two volunteers were exposed to various airborne concentrations of triethylamine. Levels of 18 mg/cu m for eight hours caused subjective visual disturbances (haze and halos) and objective corneal edema. The effects faded within hours after the end of exposure. A cross-sectional study of visual disturbances was conducted in 19 workers (13 men, 6 women, mean age 45) employed in a polyurethane foam production plant. Visual disturbances (foggy vision, blue haze, and sometimes halo phemomena) were reported by 5 workers. Symptoms were associated with work operations with the highest exposure to triethylamine (TWA= 12-13 mg/cu m). ANIMAL STUDIES: TEA irritates the mucous membranes and the respiratory tract. In concentrations of 156 ppm a 50% decrease of the respiratory rate in rats was found. A 70% solution applied on the skin of guinea pigs caused prompt skin burns leading to necrosis; when held in contact with guinea pig skin for 2 hr, there was severe skin irritation with extensive necrosis and deep scarring. Five cat eyes and 1 monkey eye were exposed to triethylamine. Animals were exposed to triethylamine at rates of 0.45-0.85 mmol triethylamine/5 min for periods ranging from 1 to 5 min. Corneal epithelial damage occurred at all doses and was severe at higher concentrations. In all cases the epithelium was healed by day 4. Optical discontinuities of the stroma similar to those seen in human patients were observed at all dose levels. Convulsions observed in all rats given oral dosages of 50 mg or more. Triethylamine was tested on 3 day old chicken embryos. Malformations observed were: small eye cup 31%, defects of lids and cornea 73%, defects of beak 4%, encephalocoele or skin pimple in head 23%, open coelom 35%, short back or neck 42%, defects of wings 38%, and edema and lymph blebs 4%. Triethylamine was tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome preincubation assay. Triethylamine was tested at doses of 0, 100, 333, 1000, 3333, and 10,000 ug/plate in four Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537) in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Triethylamine was negative in these tests.",

The mean serum ethanol concn during exposure & in the first hr after exposure was 25 mmol/L, ranging from 16 to 35 mmol/L. TEA was readily absorbed during exposure & partly oxygenated into triethylamine-N-oxide. The concn in plasma of TEA at the end of the exposure were lower in experiments with ethanol intake. TEA plus ethanol plus sodium bicarbonate caused the highest plasma levels, with only minor TEA amounts exhaled. The half live of TEA in urine was similar in many experiments. The triethylamine-N-oxide excretion was lower after ethanol ingestion than after exposure to TEA alone. Urinary pH profoundly affected TEA metabolism. /SRP: A decrease of the urinary pH by one increased renal clearance of TEA by a factor of 2./A change in urinary pH by about 2 units caused a change of renal clearance of TEA by a factor of three & of the oxygenation by a factor of two. Renal clearance of triethylamine-N-oxide was not affected by urinary pH. Three subjects displayed visual disturbances in the experiments without ethanol. These same subjects did not experience any visual disturbances in those experiments containing ethanol. It was concluded that, theoretically, the ethanol intake & varying urinary pH may affect the possibility of monitoring TEA exposure through biological samples. Although there was good correlation between air TEA levels & either end shift plasma levels & post shift urinary excretion of TEA plus triethylamine-N-oxide in an industrial settling, a determination of urinary pH would help.",

Before and after every exposure, symptoms and ocular microscopy findings were recorded. Binocular visual acuity and contrast sensitivity at 2.5% contrast were also measured. Also, before and after the 40.6 mg/cu m exposure, corneal thickness was measured and ocular dimensions were recorded by ultrasonography, endothelial cells of the cornea were analyzed, and serum and lacrimal specimens were collected for the analysis of TEA. After exposure to 40.6 mg/cu m TEA there was a marked edema in the corneal epithelium and subepithelial microcysts. However, corneal thickness increased only minimally because of the epithelial edema. The lacrimal concentrations of TEA were, on average (range) 41 (18-83) times higher than the serum TEA concentrations. The vision was blurred in all subjects and visual acuity and contrast sensitivity had decreased in three of the four subjects. After exposure to TEA at 6.5 mg/cu m two subjects experienced symptoms, and contrast sensitivity had decreased in three of the four subjects. There were no symptoms or decreases in contrast sensitivity after exposure to a TEA concentration of 3.0 mg/cu m. TEA caused a marked edema and microcysts in corneal epithelium but only minor increases in corneal thickness. The effects may be mediated by the lacrimal fluid owing to its high TEA concentration. Four hour exposure to a TEA concentration of 3.0 mg/cu m seemed to cause no effects, whereas exposure to 6.5 mg/cu m for the same period caused blurred vision and a decrease in contrast sensitivity.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 57.07 mm Hg at 25 Â°C indicates triethylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase triethylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.2 hours. Triethylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, triethylamine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 51. The pKa of triethylamine is 10.78, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Triethylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 28% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, triethylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's pKa. BCFs of <4.9 measured in carp suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to triethylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where triethylamine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to triethylamine via inhalation of tobacco smoke and ambient air, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with consumer products containing triethylamine.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4.2 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Triethylamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Triethylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(2) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Experiments show that triethylamine reacts with NO-NO2-H20 mixtures to form diethylnitroamine both in the dark and on irradiation(3). On irradiation, triethylamine is highly reactive forming ozone, PAN, acetaldehyde, diethylnitroamine, diethylformamide, ethylacetamide, and diethylacetamide and aerosols(3). These experiments were performed in large outdoor chambers under natural conditions of temperature, humidity, and illumination(3). Initially the mixture was allowed to react for two hours in the dark and then exposed to sunlight. The triethylamine completely disappeared after 90 minutes of illumination(3).",

              "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",
