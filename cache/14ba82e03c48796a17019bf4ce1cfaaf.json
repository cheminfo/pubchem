Rats and mice exhaled a majority of the administered dose as either VOC (40-72%) or (14)CO(2) (10-30%). For rats, but not mice, the percentage of the dose exhaled as VOC increased between the mid ( approximately 50%) and high ( approximately 71%) dose groups; while the percentage of the dose exhaled as (14)CO(2) decreased (19 to 10%). The molar ratio of exhaled (14)CO(2) to total released bromide, which decreased as dose increased, demonstrated that the proportion of 1-BrP metabolized via oxidation relative to pathways dependent on glutathione conjugation is inversely proportional to dose in the rat.

These alkyl mercapturic acids are known or presumed biomarkers of exposure to several alkylating agents including methyl bromide, dimethyl sulfate, ethyl bromide, 1-bromopropane and 2-bromopropane. The method involves a column switching arrangement for online solid phase extraction of the analytes with subsequent analytical separation and detection using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Within day and day-to-day imprecision was determined to range from 4.5 to 12.2%. The analytical method is distinguished by its wide linear working range of up to 2,500 ug/L with detection limits ranging from 2.0 ug/L (for PrMA) to 5.1 ug/L (for MeMA) that render possible the application in various biomonitoring studies regarding exposure to alkylating agents. The results of a pilot study on urine samples of 30 individuals occupationally non-exposed to alkylating agents using the new procedure confirmed the background excretion of MeMA (<5.1-35.6 ug/L) and PrMA (<2.0-95.7 ug/L).","Markup":[{"Start":86,"Length":23,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/methylmercapturic%20acid","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-13893975"},{"Start":158,"Length":16,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/mercapturic%20acid","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-12035"},{"Start":197,"Length":16,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/mercapturic%20acid","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-12035"},{"Start":352,"Length":14,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/methyl%20bromide","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-6323"},{"Start":368,"Length":16,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/dimethyl%20sulfate","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-6497"},{"Start":386,"Length":13,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ethyl%20bromide","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-6332"},{"Start":401,"Length":14,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-bromopropane","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":420,"Length":14,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-bromopropane","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-6358"}]}]}}]},{"TOCHeading":"NIOSH Analytical Methods","Description":"The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods is a collection of methods for sampling and analysis of contaminants in workplace air, and in the blood and urine of workers who are occupationally exposed.","URL":"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/","Information":[{"ReferenceNumber":31,"Name":"NIOSH Analytical Methods","URL":"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-154/pdfs/1025.pdf","Value":{"StringWithMarkup":[{"String":"1- and 2-BROMOPROPANE 1025"}]}}]}]},{"TOCHeading":"Safety and Hazards","Description":"Information on safety and hazards for this compound, including safety/hazards properties, reactivity, incompatibilities, management techniques, first aid treatments, and more.

HUMAN STUDIES: Occupational exposure to 1-BP has been linked to neurological illnesses. Exposure to 1-BP could adversely affect peripheral nerves or/and the central nervous system. A 43-year-old male industrial worker developed muscle weakness, pain, numbness, and gait disturbance. Neurological examination indicated sensory ataxic neuropathy associated with mild impairment of upper motor neurons. He had used 1-BP as a cleaning agent for metal parts at his workplace without appropriate protection. Another case study reported that a 19-year-old male experienced weakness of the lower extremities and the right hand, numbness, and difficulty swallowing and urinating after 2 months of occupational exposure to a degreasing solvent based on 1-BP. 1-BP is cytotoxic but not corrosive, based on results from a cultured reconstructed human epidermal model (EpiDerm Skin Corrosivity Test). 1-BP can induce DNA damage in vitro in human leukocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: 1-BP did not produce cutaneous reactions in guinea pigs attributable to skin sensitization. Inhalation exposure to 1-BP caused skin tumors in male rats, large intestine tumors in female and male rats, and lung tumors in female mice. Also noted was that 1-BP, either directly or via reactive metabolites, caused molecular alterations that typically are associated with carcinogenesis, including genotoxicity, oxidative stress, and glutathione depletion. It is unclear whether induction of immunotoxicity by 1-BP plays a role in tumor development. 1-BP caused immunosuppression in rodents. In particular, it reduced the numbers of T cells and T-cell subpopulations. In addition, there is evidence that 1-BP caused an inflammatory response. In rats, exposure to 1-BP did not affect memory function or motor coordination but muscle strength decreased dose-dependently. Dose-dependent increases in spontaneous locomotor activity and open-field behavior indicated that 1-BP has excitatory effects on the CNS of male rats. Rats exposed at 1000 and 1500 ppm 1-BP for 4 to 7 weeks exhibited decreases in body weight and motor nerve conduction velocities, increased distal latency of peripheral nerves, and neuronal dysfunction in the dentate gyrus of the brain. In two-generation study, 7-week-old rats were exposed 6 hours/day, 7 days/week for 70 days prior to mating at 0, 100, 250, 500, or 750 ppm 1-BP. Females were not exposed on postnatal day 0 to 4 and only they, not their litters, were exposed during postnatal days 5 to 21. F1 rats began direct exposure at weaning. Dose-related increases in estrous cycle length at >/=250 ppm, and follicular cysts and interstitial hyperplasia of ovaries at 500 ppm were observed in F0 and F1 females. Reduced fertility and litter size was observed in the F0 and F1 generations at >/=250 ppm. Prenatal 1-BP exposure in dams can cause delayed adverse effects on excitability of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 subfield of offspring. 1-BP was mutagenic with or without metabolic activation toward Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA1535 and TA100 when tested in a closed system, but it was not mutagenic toward strains TA1537, TA1538, or TA98. However in other studies, 1-BP was not mutagenic in either of two independent bacterial mutagenicity assays, each conducted with and without metabolic activation. Bacterial strains tested included Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA1535, and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA/pKM101. 1-BP was not mutagenic in vivo when tested in mice and rats.","Markup":[{"Start":24,"Length":14,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-Bromopropane","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":40,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":69,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":347,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":407,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":719,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1050,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1056,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1195,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1268,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1383,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1521,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1698,"Length":11,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutathione","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-124886"},{"Start":1774,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1814,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1968,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":2027,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":2231,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":2318,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":2660,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":3105,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":3242,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":3483,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":3761,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"}]}]}}]},{"TOCHeading":"NIOSH Toxicity Data","Description":"Toxicity data for this compound, from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).","URL":"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm","Information":[{"ReferenceNumber":60,"Name":"NIOSH Toxicity Data","Value":{"ExternalTableName":"niosh"}}]},{"TOCHeading":"Evidence for Carcinogenicity","Description":"Evidence that this chemical does or may cause cancer.

Our previous studies showed that 1-BP impaired memory ability by compromising antioxidant cellular defenses. Melatonin is a powerful endogenous antioxidant, and the objective of this study was to explore the therapeutic role of melatonin in the treatment of 1-BP intoxication. Rats were intragastrically treated with 1-BP with or without melatonin, and then sacrificed on 27th day after 1-BP administration. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate the spatial learning and memory ability of the experimental animals, and NeuN staining was performed to assess neuron loss in hippocampus. We found that rats treated with 1-BP spent more time and swam longer distance before landing on the hidden platform with a comparable swimming speed, which was markedly mitigated by the pretreatment with melatonin in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, 1-BP-induced notable decrease in neuron population in hippocampus by promoting apoptosis, and melatonin pretreatment attenuated those changes in brain. The GSH/GSSG ratio was proportionately decreased and heme oxygenase 1 was increased in the rats exposed to 1-BP, and administration of melatonin restored them. Meanwhile, MDA, the level of lipid peroxidation product, was significantly increased upon exposed to 1-BP, which was significantly attenuated by melatonin pretreatment, indicating that administration of 1-BP could interfere with redox homeostasis of brain in rat, and such 1-BP-induced biomedical changes were reversed by treatment with melatonin. We conclude that treatment with melatonin attenuates 1-BP-induced CNS toxicity through its ROS scavenging effect.","Markup":[{"Start":0,"Length":14,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-Bromopropane","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":16,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":58,"Length":8,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/fluoride","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-19800730"},{"Start":81,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":190,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":266,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":385,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":415,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":474,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":495,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":544,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":576,"Length":5,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-962"},{"Start":790,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":962,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":1022,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1116,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":1178,"Length":3,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/GSH","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-124886"},{"Start":1182,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/GSSG","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-65359"},{"Start":1281,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1309,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":1435,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1479,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":1537,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1607,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1671,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":1714,"Length":9,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/melatonin","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-896"},{"Start":1735,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"}]}]}},{"ReferenceNumber":23,"Description":"PEER REVIEWED","Reference":["PMID:27421776","Zong C et al; Toxicol Lett 258: 249-258 (2016)"],"Value":{"StringWithMarkup":[{"String":"Neurotoxicity of 1-bromopropane (1-BP) has been reported in both human cases and animal studies. To date, neurotoxicity of 1-BP has been induced in rats but not in mice due to the lethal hepatotoxicity of 1-BP. Oxidization by cytochromes P450 and conjugation with glutathione (GSH) are two critical metabolism pathways of 1-BP and play important roles in toxicity of 1-BP. The aim of the present study was to establish a murine model of 1-BP neurotoxicity, by reducing the hepatotoxicity of 1-BP with 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT); a commonly used nonspecific P450s inhibitor. The results showed that subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection of 1-ABT at 50 mg/kg body weight BID (100 mg/kg BW/day) for 3 days, inhibited about 92-96% of hepatic microsomal CYP2E1 activity, but only inhibited about 62-64% of CYP2E1 activity in brain microsomes. Mice treated with 1-ABT survived even after exposure to 1200 ppm 1-BP for 4 weeks and histopathological studies showed that treatment with 1-ABT protected mice from 1-BP-induced hepatic necrosis, hepatocyte degeneration, and hemorrhage. After 4-week exposure to 1-BP, the brain weight of 1-ABT(+)/1200ppm 1-BP group was decreased significantly. In 1-ABT-treated groups, expression of hippocampal Ran protein and cerebral cortical GRP78 was dose-dependently increased by exposure to 1-BP. We conclude that the control of hepatic P450 activity allows the observation of effects of 1-BP on the murine brain at a higher concentration by reduction of hepatotoxicity. The study suggests that further experiments with liver-specific control of P450 activity using gene technology might provide better murine models for 1-bromopropane-induced neurotoxicity.","Markup":[{"Start":17,"Length":14,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-bromopropane","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":33,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":123,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":205,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":264,"Length":11,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutathione","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-124886"},{"Start":277,"Length":3,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/GSH","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-124886"},{"Start":322,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":367,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":437,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":491,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":501,"Length":20,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-aminobenzotriazole","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-1367"},{"Start":909,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1009,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1106,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1149,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1326,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1423,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":1656,"Length":14,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-bromopropane","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"}]}]}},{"ReferenceNumber":23,"Description":"PEER REVIEWED","Reference":["PMID:24370287","Yuan H et al; Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi 31 (11): 806-10 (2013)"],"Value":{"StringWithMarkup":[{"String":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protective effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and nervonic acid (NA) on the learning and memory abilities in rats exposed to 1-bromopropane (1-BP) and their action mechanisms.  METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats (specific pathogen-free) were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 10 for each), i.e., solvent control group, 1-BP (800 mg/kg) group, NA (150 mg/kg) + 1-BP (800 mg/kg) group, and DHA (500 mg/kg) + 1-BP (800 mg/kg) group. The rats were given respective test substances by gavage for 7 d. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed from days 8 to 12 to evaluate the rats' learning and memory abilities. After MWM test, rats were sacrificed in the next day, and cerebral cortex was quickly dissected and homogenized in an ice bath. The supernatant of the obtained homogenate was collected to measure the content of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of glutathione reductase (GR) and gamma-glutamate cysteine ligase (gamma-GCL).  RESULTS: The MWM spatial navigation test showed that the 1-BP group had significantly longer escape latency and significantly longer total swimming distance compared with the control group (P<0.05), while the DHA+1-BP group had significant decreases in escape latency and total swimming distance compared with the 1-BP group (P<0.05). The spatial probe test showed that the number of platform crossings was significantly greater in the DHA+1-BP group and NA+1-BP group than in the 1-BP group (P<0.05); compared with the control group, the 1-BP group had a significantly lower ratio of time spent in the zone around the platform to total time (P < 0.05), and the ratio was significantly higher in the DHA+1-BP group than in the 1-BP group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the 1-BP group had a 18.1% decrease in GSH content, and DHA could significantly reverse 1-BP-induced decrease in GSH content (P < 0.05). Compared with the 1-BP group, the DHA+1-BP group and NA+1-BP group had significantly decreased MDA content (P < 0.05), the DHA+1-BP group had significantly increased GR activity (P < 0.05), and the NA+1-BP group had significantly increased gamma-GCL activity (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSION: The rats exposed to 1-BP have oxidative stress in the brain and impaired cognitive function. DHA and NA can reduce 1-BP-induced cognitive function impairment in rats, possibly by increasing the activities of GR and gamma-GCL and the content of GSH in the brain.","Markup":[{"Start":52,"Length":20,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/docosahexaenoic%20acid","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-445580"},{"Start":83,"Length":13,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/nervonic%20acid","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-5281120"},{"Start":158,"Length":14,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-bromopropane","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":174,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":351,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":392,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":438,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"},{"Start":539,"Length":5,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/water","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-962"},{"Start":764,"Length":3,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ice","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-962"},{"Start":857,"Length":11,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutathione","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-124886"},{"Start":870,"Length":3,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/GSH","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-124886"},{"Start":879,"Length":15,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/malondialdehyde","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-10964"},{"Start":923,"Length":11,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/glutathione","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-124886"},{"Start":970,"Length":8,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/cysteine","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-5862"},{"Start":1057,"Length":4,"URL":"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/1-BP","Type":"PubChem Internal Link","Extra":"CID-7840"}]}]}}]},{"TOCHeading":"Antidote and Emergency Treatment","Description":"Information on antidote and emergency treatment when exposed to this chemical.

Its use in vapor and immersion degreasing operations for cleaning metals, plastics and electronic and optical components and use in dry cleaning and former use in aerosol solvents will result in its direct release to the environment. 1-Bromopropane is also produced naturally by at least 6 species of marine macroalgae and may be transported from the algae to the surrounding environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 111 mm Hg at 20 °C indicates that 1-bromopropane will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-bromopropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 days. 1-Bromopropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-bromopropane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 37. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.3X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Bromopropane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 70% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil or water. A number of pure culture studies have shown that various microorganisms are capable of degrading 1-bromopropane. If released into water, 1-bromopropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.4 days, respectively. The hydrolysis half-life of 1-bromopropane is about 26 days at pH 7 and 25 °C. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 1-bromopropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-bromopropane is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-bromopropane via inhalation of ambient air at locations where 1-bromopropane is used as dry cleaning agent, degreaser or solvent.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.","URL":"https://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-087-00/fs-087-00.pdf","Information":[{"ReferenceNumber":23,"Description":"PEER REVIEWED","Reference":["(1) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.
